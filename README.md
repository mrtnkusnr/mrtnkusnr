# 👋 Hey there! I'm Martin Kušnír 🇸🇰

### 🧑‍💻 About Me:
I'm a **Playwright enthusiast** with a passion for testing automation and web development. By day, I'm a **QA Tester** and by night, I dive into **React** projects to push my skills further, explore new technologies and have fun. 

My repositories showcase personal projects where I experiment with front-end technologies and build out ideas that pique my interest.

### 🧠 My Testing Philosophy:
I believe in **shift-left development** and aim for robust, maintainable tests that scale with the project. Using **Playwright**, I love creating tests that are efficient and cover a broad range of scenarios. The keys are: **reliability, scalability, and maintainability**.

### 🔍 What You'll Find Here:
- 🚀 **React** projects: From beginner to (hopefully one day advanced), where I tinker and learn.
- 🧪 **Test automation** with **Playwright**: Scripts that ensure my projects run smoothly.
- 📋 **JIRA & Postman (TBD)** integrations: Handling APIs and project management with ease.

Feel free to explore, leave feedback, or even collaborate. I’m always open to new ideas and challenges!
